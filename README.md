<h1>It's my PET-project in Django.</h1>
<h3>Now, this is more of a business card site than a useful web application.</h3>

The purpose of this project:
- Learning how to create a full-fledged web application with Django and HTML layout and interaction.
- Make a normal website design using CSS
- Deploing this to the server using nginx and gunicorn
- Content fields updating from psql database
- Registration form saving in psql database

Now app uses:
- Backend:
    - Django framework
    - PostgreSQL
- Frontend:
    - HTML 
    - CSS:
      - personal styles
      - bootstrap
    - small part of JS

In the future I want:
- Make an admin account (not in the Django admin panel) for interacting with content and users.
- Add the ability for the admin to write posts and add pictures (not in the Django admin panel).
- Make a user account.
- Add user interaction with the site owner through private messages
- Integrate calendar
